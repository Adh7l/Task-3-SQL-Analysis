Task 3 – SQL for Data Analysis (Beginner)

For this task I used SQLite (DB Browser) to practice basic SQL data analysis. I created a small ecommerce style database with customers, orders, products and order_items. Then I ran different types of SQL queries like joins, group by, subqueries, having clause etc. The goal was to learn how to extract useful info from structured data.
Tools I used

DB Browser for SQLite

SQLite engine

ecommerce.db (database I made)

SQL script with all queries

What I did

Created tables for customers, products, categories, orders and order_items.

Inserted some sample data.

Wrote and ran SQL queries like:

WHERE and HAVING

INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN

AVG revenue per user

Subquery to find who spent more than average

Sales by category

Created a SQL View (vw_customer_sales)

Query with EXISTS

Took screenshots of all outputs as required.

Main Learnings

WHERE filters rows before aggregation, HAVING works after aggregation.

Joins help combine data from multiple tables.

Subqueries are useful for comparing each row against an aggregate.

Views help save a query and use it again easily.

ARPU = total revenue / number of customers.

SQL is very helpful for structured data and reporting.
